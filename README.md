# Information for Infineon Hackathon Participants
Welcome to the [Infineon Hackathon](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/hackathon/2021-eit/) [Sound Track](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/hackathon/2021-eit/#sound)!

## Track
The sound track is a very open track and has no specific challenge. The general idea is to use a Raspberry Pi with our [IM69D130 stereo microphone Shield2Go](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/s2go-memsmic-im69d/) to come up with audio Machine Learning application ideas and implement them. For this, two example environments are given: Python and Edge Impulse. You can of course also use another language or framework of your choice, but for these two we provide examples.

Please refer to [this page](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/hackathon/2021-eit/#overview) for further details on the Hackathon and judging criterias.

## Documentation
This repository contains getting started guides and documentation which should help you to work with the Infineon microphone and the Raspberry Pi board we sent to you. You can skip the readme below and directly navigate to our Raspberry Pi I2S [getting started guide](https://github.com/Infineon/i2s-microphone/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Getting-Started).
